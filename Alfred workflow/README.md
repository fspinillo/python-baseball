Initial version of my baseball script, but for Alfred. It works by pulling in game data based on the
abbreviation of a specific team.

The workflow was made using [deanishe's](http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/tutorial.html) Alfred library.

######To-do
* return game data without a team
* case insensitive team searching
