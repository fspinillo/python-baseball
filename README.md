python-baseball
===============

This is a simple python script to pull in the current scoreboard for the day from MLB.com. If no score is present it displays the start time for the game.

The user will be prompted to entire the abbreviation for whichever team they'd like to get scores for, or they can just enter scores to get all the score data.
