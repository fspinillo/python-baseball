This is a simple python script to pull in the scoreboard information for the days games.

When initiated you'll be asked for a team. The abbreviations are based on how they're kept in the data. You can also

just leave it blank for all the games.

'What team do you want? ex. SF or NYY'

######To-do:
* include error check
* include pitcher and batter info for single games
* build dictionary for team abbreviations
