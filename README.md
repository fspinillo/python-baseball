This is a simple python script to pull in the scoreboard information for either the previous day, or current day
game data.

When initiated you'll first be asked for which day, today or yesterday. 

> Today or yesterday?

Then you'll be asked for a team abbreviation. The abbreviations are based on how they're kept in the data.
You can also just leave it blank for all the games.

> What team do you want? ex. SF or NYY
